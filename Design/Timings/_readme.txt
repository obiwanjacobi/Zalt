Timing definition files are written in json for the http://wavedrom.com langauge.
A windows editor is available but also an online editor (although saving images is a not possible) at http://wavedrom.com/editor.html
Images (png) are exported using the windows editor.

Names of the json definition files and their images are kept the same.
