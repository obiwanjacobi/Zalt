                                 Compiled November 1982

          Applicable products and version numbers:  CP/M    V1.4,  V2.0,  V2.1,
          and V2.2

          Program:  DDT.COM

               DDT   uses RST 7 (machine instruction 0FFH) to set break points.
          To  change the restart number, modify the three bytes indicated by ??
          in  the  following  procedure  for  a  new  restart  instruction  and
          location.  The  restart  instruction  uses  the bit pattern 11XXX111,
          where XXX is the restart number you use.  (AFH is RST 1, B7H  is  RST
          2,  and  BFH  is RST 3.)  The restart location is usually the restart
          number times 8.  Do not use RST 0 because it is reserved for CP/M.

               The following procedure applies to DDT supplied with  CP/M  V2.1
          and  V2.2.  For V1.4 and V2.0, change the instructions at 19B and 19E
          to the following:

                  019B  sta  fe4
                  019E  sta  10ee

               Make a back-up copy of DDT.COM before you use DDT  to  make  the
          following changes:

               To change the restart number for DDT in the future, modify  only
          the 3 bytes 1EBH, 1ECH and 1EDH.
