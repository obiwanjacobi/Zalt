                                 Compiled November 1982

          Applicable products and version numbers:  CP/M   V2.2

          Program:  MOVCPM.COM

               You can modify  MOVCPM.COM  to  configure  CP/M  V2.2  for  page
          boundaries (256 bytes) instead of kilobyte boundaries.

               Make a back-up copy of MOVCPM.COM before you use DDT    to  make
          the  following  changes.  Save  the  changes  in  a  new  file  named
          PGMOV.COM.  The first argument designates the size of the  system  in
          pages  that  PGMOV  is to construct.  The first argument is optional,
          but must range between 64 and 255 (decimal) if used.
