          Applicable products and version numbers:  CP/M   V2.2

          Program:  PIP.COM

               When using the SUBMIT and XSUB utilities to execute  multiple
          PIP  commands  from a SUBMIT file, it is not possible to exit from
          PIP automatically.   The SUBMIT utility does not accept lines with
          only a carriage return.

               This application note patch modifies PIP so a period  can  be
          used to exit from PIP instead of a carriage return.  In the submit
          file, place a single period (.) on a line by itself after the last
          PIP command to be executed.

          Procedure:

               Make a back-up copy of PIP.COM before you make  any  changes.
          The  program  DDT    is  required  to  make  the changes.  Use the
          following sequence of commands.
