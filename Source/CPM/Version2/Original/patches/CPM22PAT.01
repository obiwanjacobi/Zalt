                                 Compiled November 1982

          Program:  MOVCPM
          Products and Serial Numbers Affected:  CP/M  V2.2

          Error Description:

               The following modification affects only CP/M systems  that  use
          the optional blocking  and deblocking  algorithms listed in the CP/M
          Operating System Manual.   When you  update  a  file  under  systems
          using  the algorithms with no data added to the file, the last block
          of updated records is not written to  that  file.   Contact  Digital
          Reserach  or  your CP/M distributor if you are not certain that this
          patch applies to your system.

          Patch Procedure:

               Make a back-up copy of MOVCPM.COM before you use DDT   to  make
          the  following  changes.  Use  the  Assemble command (A) and the Set
          command (S).  After you make the  changes,  return  to  the  Console
          Command  Processor using the G0 command and save the modified memory
          image on disk.  Update the  memory  image  on  tracks  0  and  1  by
          executing the new MOVCPM program as described in the CP/M  Operating
          System Manual and by integrating your customized I/O system.
