          Program:  SUBMIT.COM
          Products and Serial Numbers Affected:  CP/M  V2.2

          Error Description:

               If drive A is not the default drive when  you  run  the  SUBMIT
          program,  the  $$$.sub  file  is  created on the currently logged-in
          disk.  Therefore, you cannot run a SUBMIT job from any  drive  other
          than  A.  After  you  make  the following changes, the system always
          creates the $$$.sub file on drive A.


          Patch Procedure:

               Make a back-up copy of SUBMIT.COM before you use DDT   to  make
          the following changes.
