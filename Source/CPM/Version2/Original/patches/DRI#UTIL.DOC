The two short utility programs in this library were sent to me
by Digital Research, Inc.  I have obtained their permission to
place them on the rcpm networks since DRI has released them to
the public domain.  They are very useful to me, and I hope
that they will prove the same to you.
 
SEEP.ASM is a utility to toggle ^P inside submit files.
DEXSUB.ASM cancels xsub in a submit file to allow console entry.
Both programs are well documented with comments.
