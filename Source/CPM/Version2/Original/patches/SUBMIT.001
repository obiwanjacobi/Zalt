Using control characters in a SUBMIT file
-----

        Question:  How  do I enter control characters into a SUBMIT file?
The instructions on page 28 of the CP/M manual do not seem to work.

        Answer:  SUBMIT requires you to enter '^z' to place a CTRL Z in the
file.  The problem comes in that SUBMIT also converts all characters to
uppercase.  The following patch suggested by Digital Research will  modify
SUBMIT to require '^Z'.

A>ddt submit.com
DDT VERS 2.2
NEXT  PC
0600 0100
-s442
0442 61 41
0443 32 .
-g0
A>save 5 submit.com

        This alternate patch will allow lowercase characters to be entered
which is also extremely helpful when using XSUB and ED with strings that
require lowercase characters.

0371 32 .

        The following example submit file (using only the alternate patch)
uses ED to search a file and replace all lowercase strings 'recieve' with
'receive'.

xsub
ed file.doc
#a
b#srecieve^zreceive
e

        It should be mentioned that in no case can the control characters
'^P' or '^C' be used in a submit file to obtain the normal functions of
console input for printer toggle or warm start.
