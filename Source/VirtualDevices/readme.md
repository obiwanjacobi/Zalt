VirtualDevices

VirtualDevices is a Qt C++ project that connects to the Zalt System Controller PSoC over USB.
The VirtualDevices application simulates devices that would be accassible to the Zalt system.

I hope to replace these in the future with physical implementations including a high-speed
system IO-bus.
