# Zalt target configuration file for z88dk
#
# Zalt is the name of my homebrew Z80 computer.
# 'Z' stands for the Z80
# 'alt' stands for alternative - because it is not really a retro design with old components.
# And of course it refers to salt...
# It also refers to an ancient mythelogical creature 'Zalty'...
#

# Asm file which contains the startup code (without suffix)
