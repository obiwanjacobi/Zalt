#TODO Zalt Bios

* remove asm vars from page0. Page0 will be read-only.
* look at filling gaps between rst addresses
* library function implementations into a single file. Linker uses the source file boundary to include/exclude code.
* Investigate the zx-next target: *The zx next target has its 2MB memory divided in two ways as 16k banks or 8k pages (so two naming systems for the same memory) and an independent memory space in 8k chunks that can only appear at address 0x2000. In this system, there are rules attached to the section names mapped to these memory regions. Some naming rules enforce 16k or 8k boundaries and another allows code or data to flow to succeeding banks or pages. Other naming rules allow you to create new section names that are inside the machine's banks. So you can define section names inside BANK 40, for example, and even an ORG so that the relative placement inside the 16K bank is specified. The linker will sequence stuff inside each bank appropriately. The target also has exe forms that can describe what's in memory arbitrarily so appmake automatically makes exes that can cover the full 2MB space. BTW for this target, it's found better to have the programmer decide which banks things should be placed in rather than the linker and I think that will turn out to be the case generally. There is an exe type where the operating system loads into available memory banks instead of absolute ones but the programmer still allocates to banks, though they are logical rather than physical bank numbers.*
* investigate zobjcopy and appmake utilities for making `exe` file formats
