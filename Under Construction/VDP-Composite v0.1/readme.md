# Zalt Video and Audio

This Board contains the V9958 (video) and a YM2149 (sound) vintage chips.
It contains the full set of DRAMs for the V9958, that is a VRAM of 128kB and an extra 64kB extension.

The video signals are available on an IDC connector with grounds separating each signal. RGB and Composite video as well as Chroma and Luma (s-video) signals are present. Note that this is not VGA! Also the stereo Audio is available on this connector.

The YM2149 generates 3 channels of sound which are mixed into a stereo audio output. It also exposes 2 8-bit IO-ports which are brought out on the Audio/Video header.

In addition the board contains a register to hold an RST instruction for Interrupt Mode 0 or an Interrupt Vector for Mode 2 that can be set in software and is put on the bus when an interrupt acknowledge is detected. A jumper can be switched to enable/disable (for IM1 for instance) this option. The interrupt is optionally generated by the V9958.

The YM2149 circuit was copied from this YM2149 fro the RC2014 project. https://github.com/electrified/rc2014-ym2149
(although I only used the channel mixing resistors)
